#### Usage:
    Install wamp (windows) / xamp (linux) / mamp (mac)
    To manage your database, you can log in phpmyadmin. [user:'root'|password:''|server:'mySQL'] (on mac, password:'root')
    Clone the project : git@github.com:iliam-12/JobBoard.git
    You can import the configs/bdd.sql in phpmyadmin. You should have accounts/announces data loaded.
    Go to http://localhost/T-WEB-501-MAR-5-1-jobboard-iliam.amara/accueil.php (if you are on mac, you should add a 8888 PORT in configs/config.php and update configs/database.php. Then, you would rectify localhost by localhost:8888 in the url.)
